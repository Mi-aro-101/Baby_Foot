This is a little project I created
Do not be intimitated by It's name, It is not really a babyfoot. Well obviously it is one but a ugly one
It is not Like all good games but the main purpose of this was :
    To learn how to use C# manually without an IDE like visual studio
    To connect C# with a SQLite database and make it work along C# manually
    Execute manually the program in command prompt

Babyfoot is just a middle point I needed to reach to achieve those goals

Speaking of the goals, they were successful ;-) 

Requirements : 
    All the requirements are in "Dependencies" folder where you can find : 
        System.Data.SQLite.dll the "pilot" or I do not know how to call it that will be the connector of C# code to a SQLite database
        sqlite3 that you will need to integrate in the environment variable in order to use it permanently in command prompt

NB : If you want to use System.Data.SQLite.dll along with the script I provided, You must put in the root folder of you project
        otherwise, you must change the script "Compiler.bat"
    And as you can see, the script extension is ".bat" that means It only runs on Windows OS
    You must have dotnet installed to compile your C# code and integrate csc to you environment variable or change the script
